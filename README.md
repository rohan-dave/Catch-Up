# Catch-Up
A social app with no "friend list" restriction, so the user can share openly with anyone around the world. Developed for iOS with Swift 2.0, Firebase to store user data and ImageShack API to store images. The app features a real-time feed where the user can see other users posts.

Simplified the login and signup button with a single button for a hassle free login. If the user exists, it logs them in or if they don't, it creats a new user.
